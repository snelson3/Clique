## Multi Button Activation Branch

I have added the ability for hard mode to require 3 button activations. A future modification may make this number configurable in the apworld

extra folders:
   - worlds: modified StS to include extra "Game Completed" location, and modified Clique to have three button activation items
   - Players: example yamls showing using this with 'Shahrazad' and plando to unlock a final slay the spire world after beating the other three

# Clique

~~The greatest game ever designed by anyone ever.~~ An early april fools and "shitpost" game for Archipelago. This is the client implementation for the game.

Play the game at [clique.pharware.com](http://clique.pharware.com)!
Play locally with `npm install` and `npm start` then localhost:3000

This repository does not include assets, however they are optional to run.

This is also an example of the archipelago.js library in use.
